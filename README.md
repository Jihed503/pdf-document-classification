# Arabic Document Classification Project

## Description
This project is designed to classify Arabic documents into seven distinct categories: Religion, Culture, Sports, Politics, Technology, Medical, and Finance. The process involves converting a given PDF document written in Arabic to an image, extracting text from this image, and then classifying the text using a BERT-based model. This is particularly useful in processing and categorizing Arabic documents without manual labeling.
